public class TernaryOperator {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.println(3<2?3:2);//this program will print the minimum of two numbers. The statement is like that : is 3 less than 2? if yes 3 is the output otherwise 2 is the output. Ternary operator can be considered as short for if then else condition. It is the only one operator that accepts more than two (3) arguments at a time.
